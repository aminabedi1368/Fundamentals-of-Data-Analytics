# Data Analytics Project

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of three tasks focusing on data analytics for business problems.

## Task 1: Retail Sales Data Analysis Using Linear Algebra and Regression

### Overview
In this task, we analyze sales data from a retail company using linear algebra concepts and regression analysis.

### Files
- `task1_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code for Task 1.
- `sales_data.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis of sales data.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: The sales dataset was loaded and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies.
2. **Linear Algebra Analysis**: Utilized vectors and matrices to identify trends and patterns in sales figures.
3. **Regression Analysis**: Applied regression algorithms to predict future sales based on historical data.

### Results
- Visualizations: Plots showing trends in sales over time.
- Regression Model Performance: Evaluation metrics for the predictive models.

## Task 2: Production Process Enhancement Using Statistical Techniques

### Overview
This task focuses on enhancing the production process of a manufacturing company using statistical techniques.

### Files
- `task2_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code for Task 2.
- `production_data.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis of production process data.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Loaded and preprocessed production data.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Employed ANOVA and t-tests to identify factors influencing product quality.
3. **Visualization**: Presented visualizations to support the findings.

### Results
- Identified key factors influencing product quality.
- Proposed strategies for improving the production process based on the analysis.

## Task 3: Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions Using Anomaly Detection

### Overview
This task involves detecting potential fraud cases in credit card transactions using data analytics techniques.

### Files
- `task3_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code for Task 3.
- `transaction_data.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis of credit card transaction data.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Loaded and preprocessed transaction data.
2. **Linear Algebra Representation**: Utilized vectors and matrices to represent transaction data.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Applied Isolation Forest algorithm to detect fraudulent transactions.
4. **Visualization**: Visualized suspicious transactions flagged for further investigation.

### Results
- Identified irregular transaction patterns indicative of fraud.
- Provided flagged transactions and characteristics for further investigation.
